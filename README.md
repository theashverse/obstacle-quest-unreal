# Pookie Adventure (Obstacle Runner Game)

This project is my first proper implementation of C++ in Unreal Engine. Before this, I had worked on smaller logic pieces, but this is the first time I combined my skills into a complete mini obstacle-runner style game.

As someone who’s always been fond of games since childhood, I never thought I’d actually be able to create them. Unreal Engine changed that for me — providing free props and a powerful development platform.

I didn’t build everything from scratch, but instead used my C++ knowledge to control the character’s movement, interactions, and obstacles. I also explored Unreal’s Blueprint system and used it alongside C++ to enhance the project.

Note: This project includes only one playable level because my main goal was not to build a complete game, but to practice my C++ skills and integrate them into an Unreal Engine world.

## What I Did:
- Learned about Unreal Engine structure (Content, Blueprints, C++)
- Integrated character movement using C++ classes
- Combined downloaded beginner props with my own C++ logic
- Created an obstacle course using assets, materials, and Blueprints
- Debugged and fixed issues (some of them took 12 hours to realize and fix)
- Did not just copy the tutorial — I experimented, tweaked, and built my own contributions
- Learned from the Udemy: Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer Course (huge credit to the amazing instructor)

## Time Invested:
- Around 12+ hours of debugging alone
- Days and nights of trial and error
- A project that taught me persistence, problem-solving, and gave me massive happiness seeing it finally work

## What’s Next?
I’m more confident than ever and can’t wait to build future games fully from scratch.  
This project shaped my learning, and this is just the beginning of my Unreal Engine journey.
